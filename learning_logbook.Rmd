## Tree Dormancy (Chapter 3)
Exercises on tree dormancy

1. Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer. <p>

<p>

2. Which are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlies scales? <p>
   * Standardizes the phenological stages and make them easily recognizable under all field conditions across species to have an easily comparable metric for classification.
   * Two digit code allows two orders of scale, where the macro stage (principal growth stages) is represented by the first digit and describes time spans and the second digit specifies micro stages (secondary growth stages) precise steps within.
<p>

3. Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:

Left image: 56 - Flower pedicel elongating (in the top most bud sepals are showing a white tip)<br>
Middle image: 61 to 65 - Flowering (all flowers to be seen are open, but to determine the correct percentage a broader view is needed)<br>
Right image: 89 - Fruit ripe for harvesting<br>
