## Tree Dormancy (Chapter 3)
Exercises on tree dormancy

1. Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer. <p>
<p>
As temperature requirements are dependent on the cultivar, new data about the date of dormancy has to be collected with an experimental approach first. If this data was already collected by an institute one can calculate the chilling and forcing period by using weather data and statistical methods such as a partial least square (PLS) regression analysis [@luedeling_identification_2013]. With this method the chilling phase can be calculated using the dynamic model and the forcing phase is calculated using growing degree dates (GDD). Knowing in which specific timespan chilling and heat is especially important for a cultivar a fitting one can be selected for the region. Site-specific knowledge is also essential to pick future-proof cultivars that are already adapted for global warming.

2. Which are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlies scales? <p>
   * Standardizes the phenological stages and make them easily recognizable under all field conditions across species to have an easily comparable metric for classification.
   * Two digit code allows two orders of scale, where the macro stage (principal growth stages) is represented by the first digit and describes time spans and the second digit specifies micro stages (secondary growth stages) precise steps within.
<p>

3. Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:

Left image: 56 - Flower pedicel elongating (in the top most bud sepals are showing a white tip)<br>
Middle image: 61 to 65 - Flowering (all flowers to be seen are open, but to determine the correct percentage a broader view is needed)<br>
Right image: 89 - Fruit ripe for harvesting<br>

## Climate change and impact projection (Chapter 4)
Exercises on climate change
1. List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate. <p>

2. Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of the recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned. <p>

3. What does the abbreviation ‘RCP’ stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates? <p>

4. Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video. <p>
